# Future ADID Improvements

Based on my experience using the ADID framework, here are some suggestions for future improvements:

*   **Robust Regex Handling:** The `adid` script had trouble with special characters in the regex. The script should be improved to handle these characters correctly, perhaps by using `re.escape` on the user-provided regex.
*   **Idempotent Operations:** The `adid` script should be idempotent. That is, running the same script multiple times should not result in duplicated code. The script should be able to detect if a change has already been applied and skip it if necessary.
*   **Support for Different Patching Strategies:** The current `adid` script only supports replacing a block of text. It would be useful to support other patching strategies, such as inserting a block of text before or after a given line, or deleting a block of text.
*   **Improved Error Reporting:** The `adid` script could provide more informative error messages. For example, when a regex is not found, it could print the line number where the regex was expected to be found.
*   **Integration with Version Control:** The ADID framework could be integrated with version control systems like Git. This would allow for a more seamless workflow, where changes can be applied and then committed to the repository in a single step.
*   **Support for Multiple File Types:** The current `adid` script is designed to work with Python files. It could be extended to support other file types, such as YAML, Markdown, and JSON.
